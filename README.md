# Chess Game (2nd Year Magshimim Project)

This project is an interactive chess game developed as part of the Magshimim program. It was collaboratively created by a duo, leveraging C# for the client-side interface and C++ for the server-side functionality. The game establishes a seamless connection between the client and server using pipes.

## Features
* Full implementation of chess rules and game mechanics: The game includes all standard chess rules and mechanics, allowing players to experience the authentic gameplay.
    Two-player mode for local multiplayer: Play against another player locally, taking turns on the same device. Enjoy the competitive spirit and strategic challenges of chess.
* Interactive GUI interface for easy gameplay: The graphical user interface (GUI) provides an intuitive and user-friendly environment for players to make moves and interact with the game. It enhances the overall gameplay experience.
* Error handling and validation for user moves: The game incorporates error handling and move validation mechanisms to ensure that players adhere to the rules of chess. It prevents invalid moves and provides feedback to guide players.
* Win condition detection and game over state: The game detects win conditions, such as checkmate or stalemate, and triggers the game over state accordingly. Players are notified of the outcome and can start a new game or exit.
* Young Dvir Profus as a pawn (A friend of ours)
