# Chess Game (Magshimim Project)

This project is an interactive chess game developed as part of the Magshimim program. It was collaboratively created by a duo, leveraging C# for the client-side interface and C++ for the server-side functionality. The game establishes a seamless connection between the client and server using pipes.
Features

    Interactive chess game: Play a game of chess against another player.
    Client-side interface: The client-side interface is developed using C# to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.
    Server-side functionality: The server-side functionality is implemented in C++ to handle game logic, move validation, and communication with the clients.
    Seamless client-server connection: The client and server communicate with each other using pipes, ensuring a smooth and efficient exchange of data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the chess game project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone <repository-url>

    Build the server-side code:
        Open the server-side project in a C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
        Build the solution to compile the server code.

    Build the client-side code:
        Open the client-side project in a C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
        Build the solution to compile the client code.

    Start the server:
        Run the compiled server application to start the server.
        The server will listen for incoming connections from clients.

    Start the client:
        Run the compiled client application to start the client.
        The client will establish a connection with the server.

    Play the game:
        Once the client is connected to the server, you can start playing the chess game.
        Follow the on-screen instructions and use the provided user interface to make moves.
